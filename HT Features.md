## HT Features
	An HT STA operating in the 5 GHz.
	An HT STA has PHY features consisting of the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) set described in 19.3.5 and physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) formats described in 19.1.4. 
	Some PHY features that distinguish an HT STA from a non-HT STA are referred to as multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) operation; spatial multiplexing (SM); spatial mapping (including transmit beamforming); space-time block coding (STBC); low-density parity check (LDPC) encoding; and antenna selection (ASEL). The allowed PPDU formats are non-HT format, HT-mixed format, and HT-greenfield format (see 19.1.4). 
	The PPDUs can be transmitted with 20 MHz bandwidth and might be transmitted with 40 MHz bandwidth.


	An HT STA has MAC features that include frame aggregation, some block ack features, power save multi-poll (PSMP) operation, reverse direction (RD), and protection mechanisms supporting coexistence with non-HT STAs.
